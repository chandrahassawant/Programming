# Programming
 I practice programming in Java, a robust language for cross-platform applications, and C++, known for its high performance in game development and system software. I also work with ReactJS, a JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces, and HTML, the foundational markup language for creating and structuring web pages. This diverse skill set allows me to develop versatile and efficient software solutions across different platforms and applications.
